# my_portfolio: Zakk_Ryan_Haug

**Version 3.0**
Building a web-site from scratch that showcases me, as an individual, in a (somewhat) professional fashion. 
Utilizing both Bootsrap css/JS and my own custom css elements, I have created a web site that gives readers/visitors 
a basic idea of who I am, what I do, my skill sets/resume & my interests & talents. 
I've included a few pictures of myself, my fiance, our pets, and some LEGO projects I've built, as well as three short
clips from games I enjoy playing.
